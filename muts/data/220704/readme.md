# Tests

Test with AVS rotation box.

Same erros as in tdu cabonet (8022 encode signals incorerct)

Anders found wrong phases in input to box. Anders (actemuim changes phases)

Still problems

Then also found wrong phases in motor conentcion box on drive unit. Anders Changed to correct.

Then inverted encoder.

The suddely works.. Starnge.. must be rotation direction issue..Check with eider why phases was changed in both AVS box and motor conenction box.

Encoder noises at 17rpm-20rpm

check with Eider!
