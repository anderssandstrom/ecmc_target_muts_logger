Started rotating in clockwise direction (wrong)
After a short while changed direction to CCW (correct).

# Vibration

the vibartion files called *_blue_* is with accelerometer attached on blue bearing/motor housing (horizontally).
A new peak at 27Hz was found which correpsonds to Cogging tourque (70poles at 13/36Hz)

The files called *_blue_vert* is with sensor mounted verically on top of the blue cylinder
27Hz is not seen in this direction


13:13:41 add grease 21.4cm3 to upper bearing to see perfoemce on vibration and phase control
tourqe increase from 55% to 72% (approx). Small disturbance in phase but almost not noticable

vib_1khz_phasing_blue_5.log Just before grease
vib_1khz_phasing_blue_6.log just after grease

Torque increasse can be seen approx 13:14

squaking sound appeared or was noticed (in sync with "burring" sound)

phasing algorithm was coping with the quick traction increasee, just small disturbance can be seen in phase error.

## 13:53: stop and then go down in velo to 10rpm and add more grease the go up again.

ca 14:01: 10rpm add 20.8cm3 grease: 48% tourge before and go upp to 51%

Spectrum:
before grease  "vib_1khz_phasing_blue_10rpm_before_grease.log"
after grease : "vib_1khz_phasing_blue_10rpm_after_grease.log"

## 14:07 go to operational velo 23.33

## 14:17 still squeaking sounds so stop and unload radial force

## 14:19 start rampup again to without radial load to see if the new squaaking nopise dissapear.
