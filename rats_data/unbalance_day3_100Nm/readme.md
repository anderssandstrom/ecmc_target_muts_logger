Day 4:
Run phasing supoer imposed mode.
100Nm on brake
Need to increase phase velo tolerance in PLC to allow for phasing
Tried to absolute reference the system for the first time.
Positiong did not work again in the morning but then changed pos mode and it stared working agaon.
Added ref offset in phase code. So now two offsets in phase code. Maybe need to rename one as phase setpoiunt instead..
